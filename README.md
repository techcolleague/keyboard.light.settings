Laptop keyboard lighting has changed the computing game and has made space for nighttime users to power on through the darkness. The vast majority of modern laptop computers come with backlit keyboards in addition to boasting a number of other fancy features that may distract from this rather basic, but wholly necessary feature.

## How to adjust brightness on a backlit keyboard?

Your productivity depends on a number of particular elements that can make or break your flow. Sometimes it’s the brightness of your screen or your keyboard that can throw you off or exhaust your sensitive retinas.

In order to adjust the brightness on your keyboard backlights, press the backlight function key a couple of times for a dimmer illumination. This button alone functions as your one-stop-shop for all keyboard light operations.

## ## How to change the color of a backlit keyboard?

* Open Omen Gaming Hub from your Windows taskbar or via the Windows Start menu
* Select “Lighting” located on the left navigation sidebar
* At the top-right corner, make sure you select “Keyboard.” You will see three available modes: Animation, Static, and Off
* Select “Static” to manually assign specific colors to specific areas of the keyboard. The “Template” dropdown menu will reveal six different preloaded templates and a “Custom” option that allows you to design your own keyboard segmentation. These pre-existing templates will include WASD, FPS, MOBA, MMO, P1-P6, and All Keys
* After selecting a template, you will see a color guide at the bottom of the Omen Gaming Hub that will allow you to assign colors on the basic guide of advanced color options of your own selection
* Press “Apply” and marvel at your colorful keyboard setup!
